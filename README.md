# Honey
Rendering honey for the CS 348B Image Synthesis Techniques rendering competition

Project Proposal: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRQ4KA_0sGYWmtsTPPh73sgxJwfz4TTRCKeK8VJGipA/edit?usp=sharing>

Modeling Honey Comb:
- [ ] Honeycomb geometry in Blender
- [ ] Simulation of honey inside of comb, with bubbles

Physically-based Rendering:
- [ ] Implement comb BRDF, likely simulated with wax
- [ ] Implement honey BRDF

Denoising:
- [x] Read ML papers on denoising with convnets
- [ ] Integrate to PBRT pipeline

Final Rendering:
- [ ] Geometry of rest of scene
- [ ] Possible generation of a GIF?
