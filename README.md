Rendering honey for the CS 348B Image Synthesis Techniques rendering competition

Project Proposal: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRQ4KA_0sGYWmtsTPPh73sgxJwfz4TTRCKeK8VJGipA/edit?usp=sharing>

Modeling:
- [ ] Describe Honey material as volumetric media
- [ ] Describe Wax material (BRDF, etc)
- [ ] Choose environment lighting

Rendering:
- [ ] Extend SPPM for volumetric
- [ ] Extend SPPM for photon beams
- [ ] Implement Irradiance Caching

Final Rendering:
- [ ] Geometry of rest of scene
